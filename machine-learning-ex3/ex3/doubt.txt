in 
one vs all 
and 
in
ex3 prediction part



i have copied ex3.m; lrcostfunction.m; oneVsAll.m;predictOneVsAll.m from solutions
as after checking again and again i couldnt found a single difference between my code and 
their's.
obviously i have missed something as now submission led to full marks in the
assignment.
